# Telemetry Dashboard Project Plan

## Overview
Building a real-time telemetry dashboard with Python FastAPI backend and React frontend for monitoring service metrics.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI with WebSocket support for real-time metrics
- **Frontend**: React with Recharts for visualizations
- **Storage**: SQLite for time-series data
- **Deployment**: Docker compose setup

## Todo Items

### Phase 1: Project Setup ✅
- [x] Create project structure with backend and frontend directories
- [x] Initialize backend with FastAPI and dependencies
- [x] Initialize frontend with React and dependencies
- [x] Set up Docker configuration

### Phase 2: Backend Core ✅
- [x] Create data models for metrics
- [x] Implement storage layer with SQLite
- [x] Create FastAPI endpoints for metric ingestion
- [x] Add WebSocket endpoint for real-time streaming
- [x] Implement metrics processor with aggregations

### Phase 3: Data Generation ✅
- [x] Create metrics generator for demo data
- [x] Implement realistic patterns with anomalies
- [x] Set up background task for continuous generation

### Phase 4: Frontend Foundation ✅
- [x] Set up React app structure
- [x] Create WebSocket hook for real-time data
- [x] Implement main dashboard layout
- [x] Add time range and service filters

### Phase 5: Visualizations ✅
- [x] Create LineChart component for response times
- [x] Create AreaChart for throughput
- [x] Create BarChart for error rates
- [x] Create Heatmap for service health
- [x] Create StatCards for current metrics
- [x] Create AlertPanel for anomalies

### Phase 6: Polish & Testing ✅
- [x] Add dark theme styling
- [x] Implement error handling and loading states
- [x] Add Docker configuration
- [x] Create README with documentation

## Review

### Summary of Changes

The telemetry dashboard has been successfully implemented with all requested features:

1. **Backend Implementation**
   - FastAPI service with complete REST API and WebSocket support
   - SQLite storage with efficient time-series schema
   - Metrics processor with percentile calculations and anomaly detection
   - Realistic data generator simulating 5 services with various patterns

2. **Frontend Implementation**
   - React dashboard with real-time WebSocket updates
   - Six different visualization types using Recharts
   - Professional dark theme with responsive design
   - Service and time range filtering capabilities

3. **Key Features Delivered**
   - Real-time metric streaming with automatic reconnection
   - P50, P95, P99 percentile calculations
   - Threshold-based anomaly detection with alerts
   - Service health matrix visualization
   - Comprehensive stat cards showing current metrics
   - Docker compose setup for easy deployment

4. **Architecture Highlights**
   - Clean separation between backend and frontend
   - Efficient data buffering and aggregation
   - WebSocket connection management with reconnection logic
   - Modular component structure for easy maintenance

### Running the Application

To run the application:

1. **With Docker (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Manual Setup:**
   - Backend: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt && python main.py`
   - Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev`

3. **Access the dashboard at:** http://localhost:3000

The application will immediately start generating and displaying realistic telemetry data for 5 different services, complete with normal patterns, spikes, and occasional anomalies.
